                Welcome to PLR TEAM!
            </h1>
            <!-- TITLE -->
            
            <p>PLR TEAM is a Polish team, but we welcome players from around the world. If you are from another country, you can only communicate with us in English on the team chat to make sure everyone understands.</p>

            <h2>1. What are the main rules in PLR TEAM?</h2>
            <p>The main rule in our team is activity. We expect members to take part in Team Events and to play regularly.</p>

            <p>Players with a <span class="highlight azure">low garage (below 1000 GP)</span> are required to cover at least 30 km in a given week. If they fail to do so, they may be removed on Monday morning.</p>

            <p>There is no minimum mileage requirement per week for other players; however, lack of activity (including lack of participation in Team Events) may result in removal from the team.</p>

            <h2>2. What happens if I donâ€™t cover any distance in a week?</h2>
            <p>Any team member who covers 0 km in a given week will be removed on Monday morning. A person who is new to the team and shows no activity for a few days may be removed around Thursday/Friday.</p>

            <h2>3. Can I be removed if I only cover a few kilometers?</h2>
            <p>Yes, even if you cover only a few kilometers but do not take part in Team Events, you can be removed. The decision, however, depends on the current team composition and may vary depending on the situation. It is important to show a willingness to participate in Team Events.</p>

            <h2>4. What should I do if I cannot be active during a given week?</h2>
            <p>If, for any reason, you cannot be active, let us know in the chat. We are understanding and acknowledge that sometimes there may be situations that prevent you from playing.</p>

            <h2>5. How can I become a Co-Leader in PLR TEAM?</h2>
            <p>To become a Co-Leader, you must meet certain criteria:</p>
            <p>First, you must be a member of our team for at least one month (to receive 4 Monday chests).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If your garage is above 8000 GP: You must regularly take part in all Team Events, achieving very good results.</li>
                <li>If your garage is at least 2000 GP: In addition to participating in all Team Events, we require a one-time 250 km covered, and then around 200 km each week.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We set the maximum number of Co-Leaders at 6. Only one person can become a new Co-Leader in a given week (the person with the greater distance covered decides).</p>
            <p>If a new Co-Leader is appointed in a given week, the Co-Leader who covered the fewest kilometers loses their rank (this applies only to Co-Leaders who covered fewer than 200 kilometers).</p>
            <p>The conditions for becoming a Co-Leader may change in the future, so it is worth checking the website from time to time.</p>

            <h2>6. Who appoints new Co-Leaders?</h2>
            <p>New Co-Leaders are appointed exclusively by the Leader or by a Co-Leader authorized by the Leader (Salt Vampire).</p>

            <h2>7. Who can remove someone from the team?</h2>
            <p>Only the Leader can remove team members.</p>

            <h2>8. Prohibition of vulgarities and offensive behavior.</h2>
            <p>In our team, there is an absolute ban on using vulgarities and insulting other players. Anyone who violates this ban is immediately removed from the team and banned.</p>
