            <h1>
                Welcome to PLR TEAM!
            </h1>
            <!-- TITLE -->
            
            <p>PLR TEAM is a Polish team, but we welcome players from around the world. If you are from another country, you can only communicate with us in English on the team chat to make sure everyone understands.</p>
        
        <h2>What Makes PLR TEAM Special?</h2>
        
            <p>The main rule is to stay active. We expect players to join Team Events and play regularly. There is no weekly distance you must drive, but if you are inactive, you might be removed from the team. Any player who drives 0 kilometers in a week will be removed on Monday morning.</p>

            <p>Even if you drive a few kilometers but do not join Team Events, you may still be removed. This depends on the team at that time. The most important thing is to show that you want to help the team.</p>

            <p>If you cannot play for some reason, let us know in the team chat, and we will understand. Life happens, and we are flexible.</p>

            <p>For players who want to become Co-Leaders, we have clear rules:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>If your garage has more than 8000 GP, you must join all Team Events and get very good results.</li>
                    <li>If your garage has at least 1000 GP, you must join all Team Events and drive 250 kilometers once, then about 200 kilometers each week.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>If you cannot drive 200 kilometers in a week, tell us in the chat, and we will understand. But if you drive much less without telling us, you might lose your Co-Leader rank.</p>

            <p>New Co-Leaders are chosen only by the Leader or by a Co-Leader that the Leader trusts. Only the Leader can remove players from the team. This happens when someone is inactive or does not join Team Events enough.</p>

            <p>We appreciate dedication and effort. We want to build a team where people work together and stay active.</p>
