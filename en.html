                Welcome to PLR TEAM!
            </h1>
            <!-- TITLE -->
            
            <p>PLR TEAM is a Polish team, but we welcome players from around the world. If you are from another country, you can only communicate with us in English on the team chat to make sure everyone understands.</p>

            <h2>1. What are the main rules in PLR TEAM?</h2>
                <p>The main rule in our team is activity. We expect members to play regularly and participate in Team Events.</p>

                <p>All players are required to drive <span class="highlight azure">at least 10 km</span> each week. If they don't, they may be removed from the team on Monday evening.</p>

                <p>We are understanding â€“ long-term members may receive leniency depending on the situation. However, new members or those with a low garage score may be removed as early as Thursday if they haven't driven any kilometers by then (we assume they've quit playing).</p>

            <h2>2. What should I do if I can't be active in a given week?</h2>
                <p>If you can't be active for any reason, let us know in the chat. We are understanding and realize that sometimes things come up that prevent playing.</p>

            <h2>3. How can I become a Co-Leader in PLR TEAM?</h2>
                <p>To become a Co-Leader, you must meet certain criteria:</p>

                <p>First, you must be a member of our team for at least one month (enough to collect 4 Monday crates).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your garage is over 8000 GP: You must regularly participate in all Team Events and achieve very good results.</li>
                        <li>If your garage is at least 2000 GP: Besides participating in all Team Events, you must drive 250 km once, and then approximately 150-200 km each week.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>We limit the number of Co-Leaders to a maximum of 8. Only one person can become a new Co-Leader each week (the one who drove the most kilometers).</p>

                <p>If a new Co-Leader is appointed in a given week, the Co-Leader who drove the fewest kilometers loses their rank (only applies to Co-Leaders who drove fewer than 200 km).</p>

                <p>Requirements to become a Co-Leader may change in the future, so it's good to check the page occasionally.</p>

            <h2>4. Who appoints new Co-Leaders?</h2>
                <p>New Co-Leaders are appointed exclusively by the Leader (Locutus) or by a Co-Leader authorized by him (Salt Vampire).</p>

            <h2>5. Who can remove someone from the team?</h2>
                <p>Only the Leader (Locutus) can remove team members.</p>

            <h2>6. No swearing or offensive behavior.</h2>
                <p>In our team, swearing and insulting other players is strictly forbidden. Anyone who breaks this rule will be immediately removed from the team and banned.</p>
